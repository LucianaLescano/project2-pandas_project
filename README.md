This time project is all about cleaning and sorting a messy dataset. Then make a hypothesis and try to defend it. 💪🏽

## All about sharks 🦈
    This dataset is related to shark attacks, giving us information about countries, dates, gender, type of injury, additional info...

## Pandas 🐼
    We use Pandas and some other resources to clean and present a way more cute dataset.
    Sorting, changing headers, descarting some unuseful rows among other things.

## Ploting 📊
    We also use Seaborn to plot our results, making them look way more cuter and visual for other people.

## About me 🙆🏽‍♀️
    Where comes to me...
    I was not able to fully clean the final dataset I want to present. Nevertheless I know this is my first time and I gave my (almost) all. 
    Tips are always welcome, please, feel free to tell me whatever you think is going to help me improve.
